chess.

this was way too long and tedious for a school project. uw students please do not take cs246 unless absolutely necessary.

p.s., i 'out of sight, out of mind'-ed a little too hard and missed the deadline to submit a group for the project, so this is me doing 2 weeks worth of work for 3 people, except i had 2 red bulls and did it in a day cause i'm that guy. hope you enjoy!
